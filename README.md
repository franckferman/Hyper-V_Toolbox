## About

The Hyper-V Toolbox, an intuitive PowerShell script, is the brainchild of inspirations derived from Docker and Vagrant, meticulously crafted for the streamlined management of virtual machines.

This avant-garde project is a testament to our unwavering commitment to equip users with a proficient tool engineered for managing virtual machines. Our emphasis on creating a simplified yet efficient management process has led to the inception of a toolbox replete with an array of features, each designed with the explicit aim of augmenting productivity and reducing operational complexity.

Hyper-V Toolbox is a free and open-source software that simplifies the process of creating and configuring virtual environments. Acting as a wrapper around Hyper-V virtualization software, it offers an intuitive graphical user interface within a terminal. Hyper-V Toolbox caters to a wide range of users, including students studying cybersecurity, development, and network administration, as well as professionals seeking to streamline their virtualization workflow. With its comprehensive set of integrated features and options, Hyper-V Toolbox is the ideal tool for both educational and professional use.

While drawing inspiration from Docker and Vagrant, Hyper-V Toolbox doesn't intend to supplant these solutions. Instead, it provides a simplified and streamlined approach for those who prioritize a more user-friendly interface. Whether you're a novice or an expert in virtualization, Hyper-V Toolbox is tailored to make your virtual environment setup and configuration a breeze.

## Semi-Graphical PowerShell Interface: A Confluence of Convenience and Capability.

This is not merely a wrapper, it's an indispensable tool that simplifies and enriches your Hyper-V management experience. Serving as the front-line portal for the Hyper-V Toolbox project, it seamlessly manages Hyper-V operations and beyond, relieving you from the minutiae of system administration.

Hyper-V Toolbox's prowess is not confined to a single task, it adeptly manages multiple images and JSON files, offering you flexibility and control at your fingertips.

## Hyper-V Images: A Compendium of Pre-configured Virtual Environments

Our Hyper-V images are a curated collection of pre-configured environments. These images are packed with a diverse selection of tools. These images can either be retrieve locally or effortlessly retrieved online through (from) JSON files, offering you unparalleled ease and efficiency in setting up your virtual environments.
